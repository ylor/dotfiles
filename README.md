# env

An idempotent, mostly unattended tool to configure macOS with everything needed to be productive. Essential packages are installed and configured to create a fully functional development environment.

This project should be considered personal software and was developed for an audience of one.

## Prerequisites

- macOS
- internet
- sudo

## Usage

`sh -c $(curl -fsSL env.roly.sh)`

## Acknowledgements

- Omakub, Crucible, Strap - projects that embody the same spirit as this project
- Homebrew - the first project I encountered that piped an install script from curl and a pillar of my computing life
- Gum - a crucial utility that drastically transformed the DX, as a result, UX of env

## TODO

- make README nicer and add links to Acknowledgements
- support at least one Linux distro
