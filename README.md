# env

An idempotent, mostly unattended tool to configure macOS with everything needed to be productive. Essential packages are installed and configured to create a fully functional development environment.

## Prerequisites

- macOS
- internet
- sudo

## Usage

`sh -c $(curl -fsSL env.roly.sh)`

## Acknowledgements

- Homebrew - the first project I encountered that piped an install script
- Omakub & Crucible - two projects that have the same spirit as env.

## TODO

- support at least one Linux distro
