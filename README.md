# env

An idempotent, (mostly) unattended tool to configure macOS with everything I need to be productive. Essential packages are installed and configured to create my development environment.

This project should be considered personal software and was developed for an audience of one.

## Prerequisites

- macOS
- internet access
- sudo

## Usage

`sh -c $(curl -fsSL env.roly.sh)`

## Acknowledgements

- Omarchy - spiritual kinship, inspiration
- Homebrew - a pillar for macOS computing
- Gum - a crucial utility that transformed the UX of this project

## TODO

- make README nicer and add links to Acknowledgements
- support at least one Linux distro (likely Arch)
