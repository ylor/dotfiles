An (mostly) unattended tool to idempotently configure macOS to my liking.

## Prerequisites

- macOS
- internet access
- sudo access

## Usage

`sh -c $(curl -fsSL env.roly.sh)`

## Acknowledgements

## TODO

- make README nicer and add links to Acknowledgements
- support at least one Linux distro (likely Arch)
